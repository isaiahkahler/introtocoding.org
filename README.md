## What is Intro to Coding? 

Intro to Coding is a project that I'm working on with the goal of making coding eduction easier, modern, free, and accessible to all students. Right now I'm working on creating a simple online coding environment, and in the future I hope to create interactive, hands-on lessons built on top of this framework. 

This started when I helped the new technology teacher at my high school create a new coding curriculum based off of Python 3, and now I'm hoping to take that curriculum and make hands-on interactive lessons online.

## Are you trying to make another Code.org / Codecademy? 

Not exactly, but maybe one day. Into to Coding has the goal of integrating into classrooms as a free and open source coding curriculum, making it easier for teachers to teach and students to learn. With more resources, Intro to Coding could one day be available to students without a teacher, but for right now this is outside the scope of the project. I also don't plan on ever monitizing this resource for profit. 

## What's the Problem with Coding Education?

Coding education currently sucks. The problem is that technology advances at incredible speeds and education can't keep up to teach it. As a result, the coding taught in classrooms covers the boring fundamentals, which really pushes kids away with a natural interest in computers. Intro to Coding tries to balance fun and applicable programming with basic concepts to help kids find their true passion for computer science. 

## How is Intro to Coding Different?

Intro to Coding wants to teach kids with hands-on learning and interactive lessons in a way that the computer science classes haven't seen before. The goal is to use modern technology to teach modern technology, so kids -->

## The Ingredients

This project was made with **React** and **TypeScript**. 

The editor is using **[Monaco](https://github.com/suren-atoyan/monaco-react/)** (React version), the same editor built in to your favorite code editor, VS Code. 

The terminal is made using **[Xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/)**, also used by VS Code. 

The file system is still in development. 

And so is everything else.
